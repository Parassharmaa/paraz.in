### Trust

- LLMs are non-deterministic, but human actions are non-deterministic too. But trust factors for humans go beyond logic and cognitive intelligence. (That trust is evolutionary)

### Context

- An individual word has no meaning.
- Words gain meaning only in context.
- LLMs output comes from prior of context. The quality of output depends on how well context can be orchestrated.
- Same applies to the Human Language landscape, better priors lead to highly certain action predictions.

### Language

- Language is a facilitator of senses.
- Language unites input and output.
- Is there anything that cannot be explained by Language?
- One may say "Can you explain the concept of color to a blind person?"
    - But the concept of color itself is a language.
    - As language facilitates senses, absence of sense does not mean language failed to explain it.
