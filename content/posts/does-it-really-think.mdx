On iOS, when you switch from the ABC keyboard to the 123 keyboard, each symbol sits exactly where a letter used to be. Same position, different character.

So I typed this:

```
0-4-/
```

The mapping:

```
0 → P (row 1, position 10)
- → A (row 2, position 1)
4 → R (row 1, position 4)
- → A (row 2, position 1)
/ → S (row 2, position 2)
```

**PARAS.**

Another one:

```
)3""9
```

**HELLO.**
